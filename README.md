# SonarSpaceGame
My first python programing game! The goal of the game is to find the 0 cube in the least amount of tries / attempts.
I programmed this while I was at Go CODE Girl (a program set up by McMaster University and Engineering venture Academy for grades K-12)

I am in grade 7 (as of Jan 30th 2021)
I programmed this using Repl.it
